This FantasyNBA CLI application gives you access to data on all current NBA Players and Teams. Special thanks to FantasyBasketballNerd for allowing me to use their API in the construction of this application. Go and check out their awesome website at the followin link - https://www.fantasybasketballnerd.com/. This app will give you access to the current team, position, height, weight, collegiate team, fantasy ranking for their position and overall fantasy ranking for every NBA Player. You can also discover more about NBA teams by learning the conference and division they play in as well as their 3 digit team code. The app is great for learning more about the NBA in preparation for a Fantasy Basketball draft as you can think about matchups, discover which rounds might be an appropriate spot to draft certain players, and much much more. I hope you enjoy this CLI application and good luck if you're playing Fantasy Basketball this year.

## Usage

The app is extremely simple to navigate and you will be prompted in the CLI at every stage telling you exactly what you can input in order to discover further information about an NBA Player or Team. You can exit the app at any time by entering 'exit' and you can always return to the initial menu options by entering 'main menu'.
